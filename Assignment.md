## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

Write about **4 things** you expected to learn during the Git crash course (yes, we all came in with some big hopes ðŸ˜…).


**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**

**1. Concept: Commit Messages**
`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought commit messages were just quick notes like "fixed stuff" that only I would see.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Proper commit messages are crucial documentation! They help future-you and collaborators understand why changes were made.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Now I write descriptive messages like "fix: resolve mobile menu overflow issue #123" following conventional commits.

**2. Concept: Pull Requests**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I assumed PRs were only for teams to review each other's code.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: PRs are valuable even solo - they force me to review my own changes before merging.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I caught 3 styling bugs by creating PRs for my own features and reviewing the diff carefully.


**3. Concept: Git Rebase**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought rebase was some dangerous advanced feature I'd never need.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Rebasing helps maintain a clean, linear history by incorporating upstream changes.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I used git rebase -i to squash 5 messy commits into one coherent feature addition.

**4. Concept: .gitignore**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I assumed Git automatically knew which files to exclude from tracking.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Without .gitignore, I always committed node_modules and API keys!

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Now my .gitignore has patterns for dependencies, env files and IDE configs - keeping my repo clean.

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

```markdown
![Caption](path/to/your/image.png)
```

### A. Milestones and Issues
